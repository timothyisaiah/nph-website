More/longer education is linked to a reduction in the fertility rate of women (15-49 years) in Uganda
By Rachael Nagaddya, 18th August 2025.
World Health Organization defines Fertility Rate (FR) as the average number of live births a woman can have by the end of her reproductive period (15 to 49 years) if she is not subject to mortality. The World Bank estimates that the fertility rate in SSA declined from 6.5 children in 1985–1990 to 4.7 children per woman in 2017. FR is a major determinant of population growth rate and the age structure  of populations with a continuously reducing FR resulting in rapid aging of populations and the consequential lack of human labour. The economic theory explains FR as a trade-off between the number (quantity) of children a woman chooses to have and the quality of those children, how much time and resources the mother invests in each child. 
Data collected from 1988 to 2019 in Uganda shows a reduction in the FR and an inverse relationship between level of education attained and the FR of women. In part, this is because a higher level of education is a predisposing factor to the rise in contraceptive use. But also, more and longer education can bring about empowerment of women, later marriage, later onset of childbearing, and smaller family size.
