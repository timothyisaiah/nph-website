Under 5 child mortality rates in SSA against the 2030 SDG target of 25 or few deaths per 1000 live births
By Rachael Nagaddya, 22nd August 2025.
Under-five child mortality rate is the probability that a new-born would die before reaching exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births. UNICEF reported that in 2023, 4.8 million children under 5 years of age died globally and infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, preterm birth and intrapartum-related complications remain leading causes. 
Mortality of children under-5 years is a core indicator of the development of families, societies and the world at large and it reflects the macroeconomic and public health priorities and values of a country. With the SDG for under-five mortality rate set at 25 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030, the latest data from SSA countries shows that most countries might miss this goal. This implies that even for Gabon with the least deaths of 39 per 1,000 live births, resources and policy must be geared toward not only sustaining current rates of decline but also accelerating progress child survival goals.
