Prevalence of death during pregnancy, delivery and the two months after child birth in SSA 
By Rachael Nagaddya, 20th August 2025.
The larger percentage of pregnancy related deaths are preventable since health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications are well known. The complications that account for around 75 percent of such deaths are: severe bleeding after childbirth, infections, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and complications from delivery among others. In 2023, WHO estimated global maternal deaths at 260,000 women during and following pregnancy and childbirth, 87 percent of whom were from Saharan Africa and southern Asia. 
These deaths are a huge tragedy to the social and economic impact of immediate family and community which is why SDG 3.1 targets this ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 live births and maximum of 140 per 100 000 livebirths in countries known for high occurrence. However, from the latest data, even Tanzania, the better ranking country recorded 6.1 percent of women in their reproductive age die due to pregnancy related complications, it is going to be a herculean task that will require implementation of effective policies especially equitable access to high quality care in pregnancy, and during and after childbirth.
