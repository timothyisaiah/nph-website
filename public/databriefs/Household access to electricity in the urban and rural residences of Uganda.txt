The trend of household access to electricity in the urban and rural residences of Uganda

In this digital and industrial era, access to electricity is a prerequisite for transformation of economies in Africa. By 2016, 42.8 percent of the continent’s population had access to electricity with more than 600 million people living without electricity including more than 80 percent of those residing in rural areas. Electricity access is growing in SSA albeit at a slow pace; for instance, between 1991 and 2016 access to electricity rose by 20 percent but, at this rate, the region will not achieve the SDG target for universal access to electricity by 2030. Moreover, the insufferable frequency of power blackouts, high initial connection, tariffs, and monthly standard service fee for electricity have been cited in studies as some of the hindrances to grid electricity in many African countries.
Despite Uganda’s National Development Plans III & IV and the  National Energy Policy 2023 significant access to electricity disparities still persist especially in the rural residences of the country. This means that most households in rural residences still rely on inefficient energy sources such as kerosene, solar lamps that lead to severe health and environmental repercussions and economic losses.
