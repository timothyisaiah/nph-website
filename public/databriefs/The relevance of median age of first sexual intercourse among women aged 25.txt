The relevance of median age of first sexual intercourse among women aged 25-49 years in SSA
By Rachael Nagaddya, 20th August 2025.
First sexual intercourse contributes to redefining one’s identity from child/adolescent to adulthood; placing young people into a group exposed to risks of unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health outcomes. Early age of first sexual inter course has to some extent been associated with multiple sexual partners, infrequent use of condoms, unsafe abortion and HIV. Recently, more young people are showing faster physical maturity; this compounded with most parents in SSA not exposing their children to sex education leaves most young people in the whim of their peers who are into sexual promiscuity resulting in early sexual exposure. 
The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs reports that people especially the illiterate, old and some from undeveloped countries tend to round their ages to a multiple of 5 or 10 which makes the median more resistant to such errors than the mean. The goal in many countries is to delay this median age of first sexual intercourse by enacting policies that keep children in school because evidence shows that girls who have attained low education are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at an earlier age than their counterparts who have attained secondary or higher education.
