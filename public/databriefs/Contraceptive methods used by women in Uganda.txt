Contraceptive methods used by women in Uganda to meet their reproductive desires

Choice is the principle in both quality of care and the broader rights-based approach to family planning where user-centred information, counselling, and services enable people to decide and freely choose a contraceptive method that best meets their reproductive desires. Consequently, this allows couples if and when to have children by way of voluntarily and intentionally delaying, spacing or limiting pregnancies; making contraception a vital focus of the global agenda for maternal health. It can further be beneficial to men and women by improving the health, economic, and social domains of their lives. In 2019, globally, an estimated 44 percent and 4 percent of women in their reproductive age (15-49 years) used modern and traditional contraceptive methods respectively. 
The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, reported that worldwide, female sterilisation, male condoms, IUDs and the pill are the most commonly used contraceptives. As for Uganda, recent data shows that injections, implants and condoms are the most preferred contraceptive methods for women. It is therefore important to understand the mix of methods used in Uganda in order to offer insight into enabling self-sufficiency in choice, such that women access and use the method that best suits their needs.
