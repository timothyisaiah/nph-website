What could discourage expectant mothers from giving birth in a health facility in SSA 
By Rachael Nagaddya, 20th August 2025.
The period of pregnancy from inception to postnatal care is life saving for both the woman and child. It requires skilled care to ensure prevention, detection and management of complications such as postpartum haemorrhage, infections, preeclampsia and eclampsia among others, all of which can only be provided in a health facility set up. Therefore, the role of a health facility where skilled care during childbirth is provided in order to prevent or reduce maternal and neonatal mortality is indisputable. 
Regardless of this, utilization of health facility-based deliveries in SSA is hindered by reasons such as; disrespectful and abusive behaviour, abandonment of women, non-consented care, non-confidential care, non-dignified care. Yet, many governments have committed themselves to increasing the proportion of women who give birth in health facilities with some are aiming for 100 percent. This mistreatment and abuse of expectant mothers in labour widely reported in studies especially conducted in public health facilities may deter future use by affected women and those within their social circles.
