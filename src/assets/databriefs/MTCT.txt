Protecting the next generation from HIV through information dissemination of mother to child transmission in the rural and urban residences of Uganda
By Rachael Nagaddya, 18th August 2025.
Of the 1.4 million people living with HIV in Uganda, 860,000 are women and 80,000 are children. Therefore, as part of the strategy to prevent new HIV infections among newborns, Uganda has a robust prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) program which involves; following up women of reproductive age living with, or at risk of acquiring HIV throughout pregnancy to the end of the breastfeeding period. In 2022, a study by Makerere University-Johns Hopkins University showed that 90 percent of new HIV infections among infants and young children occur through MTCT which justifies why PMTCT remains a priority in the country.
Through a well-coordinated multisectoral response, the program primarily ensures information dissemination to guarantee that women are aware MTCT can be prevented during pregnancy, during delivery and through breastfeeding. The latest data shows that the percentage of women with knowledge of all three has increased to above 60 percent over the years with little to no difference between women in the urban and rural residences. Although remarkable progress has been made, studies further show bottlenecks that hinder wider access to and utilization of PMTCT such as less coverage in pregnant adolescents (10–19 years) due to disapproving health care providers.
