Severe wasting among children 24-59 months in SSA disaggregated by sex in Low Income African countries
By Rachael Nagaddya, 21st August 2025.
According to UNICEF, 1 in 1 in 5 deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, is attributed to severe wasting robbing the lives of millions of boys and girls. The biological attributes of male and female are important considerations in the public health domain and it is no wonder that different studies and disciplines hold contrary views on the relative vulnerability of male and female children. For example, in neonatal medicine, boys are known to be more vulnerable than girls, from as early as the point of conception. 
However, most recent data indicates that across several SSA countries, the percentage of severely wasted boys is higher than girls in the same age bracket and the reasons to these boyâ€“girl differences have not been extensively explored in the nutrition field. None the less, nutrition and diets for children less than 5 years should be diverse and in cases of severe wasting, Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) can save children.
