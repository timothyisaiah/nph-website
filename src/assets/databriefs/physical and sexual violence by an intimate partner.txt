Physical or sexual violence against women by an intimate partner/husband in the rural and urban residences of Uganda
By Rachael Nagaddya, 21st August 2025.
Any behaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours is violence. Intimate partner abuse is mostly done against women with risk factors including: marital discord and dissatisfaction, male controlling behaviours towards their partners, difficulties in communicating between partners and past history of exposure to violence. The effects thereof include physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health problems, may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings and traumatic experiences for the victimâ€™s children.
The WHO estimated in 2024 that 1 in every 3 women word wide has been subjected to sexual or physical abuse from an intimate partner. The latest data in Uganda shows the higher prevalence of this violence against women in rural residences is linked to some either justifying or tolerating it, and lower education levels and wealth index compared with urban women.
