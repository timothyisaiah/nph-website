Increasing caesarean section rates in Uganda
By Rachael Nagaddya, 20th August 2025.
In an effort to reduce maternal mortality, the government of Uganda has made deliberate effort to increase availability, quality, access to, and utilization of emergency obstetric care services and caesarean sections (CS) to manage and treat complications of pregnancy, labour, and delivery. However, in recent years, CS rates categorized as emergency or elective have increased worldwide (Uganda is no exception) without added benefits, raising concerns of over utilization. 
Worryingly, research affirms this trend of increase in CS in Uganda, some of which are purely maternal requests especially in urban areas, amongst the affluent populations of more educated women. These inequities are inter-related as it is more likely for women to belong to the higher wealth quintiles, and reside in urban areas, making them more likely to make independent personal choices regarding their preferred mode of delivery.
