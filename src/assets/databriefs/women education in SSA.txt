Notable strides have been made towards education women yet more work still needs to be done in SSA

Sustainable Development Goal 4 commits that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education. This is because the latter equips learners with the knowledge and skills needed to transition successfully into adulthood. However, the benefits are far more reaching and significant for girls as a protective factor against child marriage, adolescent pregnancy and malnutrition. Although considerable progress has been made towards gender parity education, equitable education opportunities remain out of reach owing to growing insecurity, violence and threats of violence that girls, especially, face in their quest for education. 
Moreover, in many African countries, women and girls continue to face socio-cultural and economic constraints which are deeply rooted in societal values and norms resulting in attainment of low education levels. This results in a never-ending cycle of unequal land rights and management, restricted access to justice and continued sexual and domestic violence among others.  The African proverb “If you educate a man you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman you educate a nation” holds true for intergenerational gains attained from educating women. Despite efforts such as Universal Secondary Education, less than half of women in Uganda have attained secondary or higher education an indication of significantly widening gender gaps in secondary and tertiary education attainment.
