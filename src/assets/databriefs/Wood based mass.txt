Wood-based bio mass remains the main source of cooking energy used by households in Uganda
By Rachael Nagaddya, 18th August 2025.
The World Bank estimates that 81 percent of SSA households rely on wood-based biomass energy (fuel wood and charcoal) for cooking. Further reports by the African Renewable Energy Access Program show that annually, nearly 600,000 Africans die and millions more suffer from chronic illnesses caused by air pollution from inefficient and dangerous traditional cooking fuels and stoves. This public health crisis not only disproportionately harms women and children especially in SSA but also contributes to a wide range of negative environmental and climate change effects. 
The World Bank’s Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions (ACCES) initiative seeks for a turning point in Africa’s cooking sector to a much broader uptake of cleaner efficient fuels and renewable energy. However, for Uganda, access to electricity is not expected to replace wood-based fuel use for cooking soon because the cost of cooking using electricity or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is often prohibitive.
