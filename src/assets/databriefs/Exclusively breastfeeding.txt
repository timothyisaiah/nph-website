Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months has far reaching benefits for infants in SSA
By Rachael Nagaddya, 20th August 2025.
WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months; meaning the infant only receives breast milk. No other liquids, or solids are given except oral rehydration solution, or drops/syrups of vitamins, minerals or medicines. The advantages of breastmilk are far reaching; from providing essential, irreplaceable nutrition which is a cornerstone of child survival and health, providing protection from respiratory infections, diarrhoea, to protecting against obesity and certain noncommunicable diseases later in life. 
Globally, as of 2023, 48 percent of infants aged 0 to 6 months are exclusively breastfed which is an indication that breastfeeding is often practiced as supplementary feeding rather than exclusively. This is against the global breast-feeding collective target of 70 percent by 2030. With the median EBF duration in Mali as little as less than 2 months to 5 months in Rwanda, all of which is below what is recommended means that millions of children across SSA are not optimally getting the required nutrients and health benefits from breastmilk.
