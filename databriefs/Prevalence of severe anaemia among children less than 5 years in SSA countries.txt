Prevalence of severe anaemia among children less than 5 years in SSA countries
By Rachael Nagaddya, 19th August 2025.
Anaemia is the below-normal red blood cell count or haemoglobin level per unit volume in peripheral blood and in severe anemic cases this measurement is below 7g/dl. The top three contributing causes globally are dietary iron deficiency, Vitamin A deficiency, and Beta-thalassemia trait. Anemia in children below 5 years is a public health problem worldwide because it under mines the attainment of SDG 2.2. 
Children under 5 years have a greater need for nutrition and higher consequence as a result of the lack thereof due to lesser reserves which makes anaemia in under-five children is a special case. At an individual level, childhood anaemia contributes to poor motor and cognitive development, poor school performance, as well as increased morbidity and mortality while socioeconomically, it negatively impacts the well-being and productivity of a country. From the recent data, 5 percent of children under 5 years in Nigeria are severely anaemic in comparison to Uganda’s approximate 2 percent. Ultimately, programs that ensure distribution of iron supplements, nutrition interventions and malaria chemoprevention are mandatory across SSA.
